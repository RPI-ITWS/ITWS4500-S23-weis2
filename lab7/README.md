# Lab 7


Step 1. In the express directory, you can run:


### `npm intall`
### `npm start`


Step 2. In the react directory, you can run:


### `npm intall`
### `npm start`


Then React will automatically assign the port, thereby avoiding express port duplication and opening the website automatically.


Nothing struggle for me in this lab. I learned about how to create basic pie chart and bar chart with D3.js and everything i learned is from Internet and I put them under the reference. I learned about the correct and reasonable visualization type for different data. For example, for a pokemon's 6 stats, using pie chart would make more sense. But for the number of pokemon of each type, I used bar chart, which is good at comparing each type intuitively.


The website includes two parts. The first search bar enabling user to fetch external api to get data by pokemon's id or name. And then user can add pokemon data to form and they are able to change any feature and interact with the DB by four http verbs. For the frontend, I learned about using react bootstrap to make the website looks clean and easy to interact with. User can search to get front and back picture, abilities, types and stats for each pokemon.
