Struggles: I learned about the bootstraps grid system this time to made the website looks same on PC and mobile. Not any big struggle for this lab.

Creativity: I use a fixed navi bar with the link of open weather api. And find the website of openweather's icon to display weather icon that can match with the weather description in api. Also I use setinterval to refresh time per second. Also I utilized the max temperature and minimum temperature in api.
